      You're not going to have your mommies right behind you to wipe your little tushies... What killed the dinosaurs?
      Pissed off! It's showtime. Into the boat. Into the boat. Back to the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well listen to this one. I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions. Into the tunnel. You're the asshole on tv...
      You should not drink and bake... Back to the carpet. And if you do not listen, then to hell with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I eat green barrettes for breakfast. You belong to me. You're the asshole on tv... I'll be back. I want to make
      him talk. Shutup. Only pain. You should not drink and bake. Now! Shutup. Back to the carpet.

      I did nothing. There is no bathroom. I'm not shitting on you. Living tissue over endoskeleton. That's why i'm
      going to kill you last. The iceman cometh.
    </p>

      endoskeleton. Excuse me. Do it now. Feel how soft my skin is. Fuck you asshowr.
