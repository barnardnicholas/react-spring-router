        Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not
        that kind of girl. Go. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Are you
        okay?

        Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they
        don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared
        from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. C'mon, more,
        dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out
        to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Ahh. That's George
        McFly.

        You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. What? Hey man, the dance is over.
        Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Yeah, exactly.
